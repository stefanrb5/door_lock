Arduino Door Lock System
How It Works

This Arduino-based door lock system utilizes an Arduino Uno, an LCD 16x2 display, a matrix keypad, and a piezo buzzer. Users input a predefined password on the keypad. If the correct password is entered, the system unlocks the door. An incorrect password triggers the piezo buzzer to indicate an invalid entry.
